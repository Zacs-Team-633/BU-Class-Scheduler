	'Enterprise Architecture',
	'This course builds upon the strong technical foundation of our MSCIS and MSCS curricula, by providing students with the CIO-level management perspective and skills of an enterprise architect, in the context of the technologies that implement those architectures. Our Ross, Weil, and Robertson text provides much of the management content of the course, and the online and classroom content provide both management and technical skills. Students learn that enterprise architectures are best developed incrementally, by system development projects that are aligned with strategic goals and the enterprise architecture. The online content therefore includes many real enterprise system development case studies, showing how these enterprise systems contributed to and helped define the overall enterprise architecture. The course also includes a number of realistic enterprise architecture assignments and an incremental term project with components spanning the course, to provide students with hands on enterprise architecture experience. The course provides students with the understanding and skills needed to define and implement successful enterprise architectures that provide real value to organizations, such as substantially reducing IT costs while improving performance, agility and alignment of information technology to business goals. Prereq: MET CS 682. Or strategic IT experience. Or instructor''s consent. 4 credits.',
