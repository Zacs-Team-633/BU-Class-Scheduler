	'This course introduces basic concepts in discrete mathematics, computer systems and programming that are necessary for modern computing systems. It also develops analytic and logical thinking and prepares students to take graduate-level courses in software development degree. This course first reviews the basic concepts in discrete mathematics including logic, sets, functions, relations and combinatorics. Then it discusses the fundamental concepts in computer systems such as computer organization, basic OS concepts, CPU scheduling, memory management, process management and synchronization. Concurrently with the above mathematics and systems studies, programming concepts are introduced and practiced throughout the whole course using Python',

	'The goal of this course is to provide students with the mathematical and practical background required in the field of data analytics. Starting with an introduction to probability and statistics, the R tool is introduced for statistical computing and graphics. Different types of data are investigated along with data summarization techniques and plotting. Data populations using discrete, continuous, and multivariate distributions are explored. Errors during measurements and computations are analyzed in the course. Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing topics are also examined. The concepts covered in the course are demonstrated using R. Laboratory Course. Prereq: MET CS 546 or equivalent knowledge, or instructor''s consent.',
